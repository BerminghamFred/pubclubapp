# Area Featured Pubs System

## 🏆 **How It Works Now**

The homepage carousel now uses **featured pub photos** selected from the admin interface instead of static area images.

## 🎯 **Admin Management**

1. **Go to Admin Dashboard** → "Area Featured Pubs"
2. **Select an area** from the list
3. **Choose a pub** that best represents that area
4. **The pub's photo** will automatically appear in the carousel

## 💡 **Why This Approach is Better**

- **Authentic photos** - Real photos from actual pubs in each area
- **Easy management** - Change featured pubs anytime from admin
- **No manual image uploads** - Uses existing pub photos from Google Places
- **Always up-to-date** - Photos are automatically managed

## 🎨 **Current Setup**

- **Top Areas**: Westminster (114 pubs), Bromley (90 pubs), Camden (87 pubs), etc.
- **Photo Source**: Google Places photos from selected pubs
- **Fallback**: Gradient placeholder if no featured pub is selected

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

1. Go to `/admin/area-featured-pubs`
2. Select each area and choose the best representative pub
3. The carousel will automatically update with the selected pub photos!

This system ensures your homepage always shows authentic, high-quality photos that truly represent each area's pub scene.
